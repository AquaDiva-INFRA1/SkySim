## OVERVIEW

This repository contains a large variety of Skyline algorithms. They can run on synthetic data, or using data provided by CSV files.
Furthermore, experiments with multiple runs are supported.

The software was originally created by [Christoph Lofi](https://bitbucket.org/clofi/skyline_simulator) and slightly modified for the use in JOYCE.

### DATA

You can find CSV data files in the ./data folder.

### SUBSPACE SKYLINES

Please have a look on ifis.skysim2.experiments.JustRunASubspaceSkyline to check how that works. Currently, only one subspace-enabled algorithm is included.
